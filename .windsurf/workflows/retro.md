---

Reflect on the most recent changes, write a short retrospective note and then save that to memory.

Include four sections (bold headings, bullets OK, ≤ 120 words total):  
1. **Wins & Misses** – what worked, what didn’t.  
2. **Patterns** – reusable insights to apply next time.  
3. **Next-Time Checklist** – concrete actions to avoid past pitfalls.  
Return only the markdown note.
